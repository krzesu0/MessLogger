# MessLogger
Logger for facebook's messenger chat. Long story short, I made this only because my **f** up friends would overuse delete feature.

## Usage
I am currently working on daemon or console-free method of doing this.
To run it just type
```bash
python3 main.py
```
It will propmt you for email and password, after logging in it will start to listen for any messages.

### TODO:
- Expand this readme lmao
- Add comments to code
- Add daemon capabilities
- Add other way of changing flags than manually in python file.
